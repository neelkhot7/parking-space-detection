🅿️ Parking Space Detection System 🅿️

Welcome to the Parking Space Detection System repository! This project utilizes Python and computer vision techniques to detect available and occupied parking spaces using a camera feed. Designed to streamline parking management, our system offers real-time monitoring of parking spaces, enabling efficient utilization of parking facilities.

🔍 Key Features:

Camera-based Detection: Leveraging computer vision algorithms, our system analyzes camera feeds to detect available and occupied parking spaces in real-time.

Accuracy: With advanced image processing techniques, the system accurately identifies parking spaces, even in varying lighting and environmental conditions.

Real-time Monitoring: Monitor parking space occupancy dynamically, providing up-to-date information to users and administrators.

Efficiency: Streamline parking management processes by automating the detection of available spaces, reducing congestion and improving user experience.

🌟 Why Choose Our Parking Space Detection System?

Efficiency: Optimize parking space utilization and minimize congestion with real-time monitoring and detection capabilities.

Accessibility: Provide users with valuable information about parking space availability, enhancing convenience and accessibility.

Scalability: Easily scale the system to accommodate parking facilities of any size, from small lots to large parking structures.

🔧 Installation Instructions:

Install OpenCV, cv2, NumPy.

The output you will see is trained on a video CarPark.mp4
